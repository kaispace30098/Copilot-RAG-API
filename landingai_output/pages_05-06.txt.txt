## A-F Fiscal Year 2024-2025 Business Rules

## Introduction

These business rules detail Arizona's 2025 A-F Letter Grade Accountability System for educators, parents, and other stakeholders. The Arizona Department of Education's (ADE) mission is "We are a Service Organization committed to raising academic outcomes and empowering parents." As a state, we are also committed to holding schools accountable to this goal using an accountability model that differentiates the performance of schools.

Using the A-F Letter Grade Accountability System, Arizona makes annual accountability determinations for schools based on student academic outcomes. The accountability system outlined here uses several metrics to measure student learning and growth in Arizona public schools.

## Business Rules

Once the Arizona State Board of Education approves the A-F Letter Grade Models for a given fiscal year, business rules that reflect the approved model are created and shared with stakeholders on the Accountability & Research website ([http://www.azed.gov/accountability-research/resources/](http://www.azed.gov/accountability-research/resources/)). Following the calculation of A-F Letter Grades, corresponding release by the State Board of Education, and conclusion of the appeals process, the ADE Accountability team adds descriptive statistics and graphs at which point the business rules are finalized.

Prior to finalizing the business rules, some changes may occur including small edits to the text (e.g., punctuation, spelling, formatting, etc.), clarifications to the description of components and the addition of details (i.e., statewide averages).

The Accountability & Research team will continue to post the most updated document as quickly as possible for stakeholders. To ensure you are using the most up to date version, you should bookmark the applicable link from our website as opposed to saving or printing a copy.
