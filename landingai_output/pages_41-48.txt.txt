- *Non-FAY students included in Chronic Absenteeism calculations.*  
- **Subgroup improvement requires n-count of 10 in both 2024-24 & 2023-23 (2 pts per subgroup, max 6 pts).**  
- ***Scores capped at 10.***  

#### Updates for FY 2024-24
- Math test records for RAEL students are excluded from subgroup proficiency calculations.

### Grade 8 Math Performance Component

#### Intent & Details
- Measures schools' success in preparing students for high school math.
- Incentivizes increasing **highly proficient** students & reducing **minimally proficient** students.

#### Calculation & Criteria
- **Inclusion:** FAY students taking Grade 8 AASA/MSAA Math in FY 2024 & 2025.
- **RAEL students excluded.**

**Formulas:**
\[
pct\_gr\_8\_hp = 100 \left( \frac{gr\_8\_stu\_hp}{total\_gr\_8\_stu} \right)
\]
\[
pct\_gr\_8\_mp = 100 \left( \frac{gr\_8\_stu\_mp}{total\_gr\_8\_stu} \right)
\]

#### Final Points (0, 2.5, or 5 points)
- **Highly Proficient:**  
  - 2.5 pts if **≥60% HP** OR **maintains/increases HP from FY 2024 to FY 2025.**
- **Minimally Proficient:**  
  - 2.5 pts if **≤10% MP** OR **maintains/decreases MP from FY 2024 to FY 2025.**

### Grade 3 ELA Minimally Proficient Component

#### Intent & Details
- Rewards schools for reducing Grade 3 **minimally proficient** students.

#### Calculation & Criteria
- **Inclusion:** Grade 3 FAY students with AASA/MSAA ELA scores in FY 2024 & 2025.
- **RAEL students excluded.**

**Formula:**
\[
pct\_gr\_3\_mp = 100 \left( \frac{gr\_3\_stu\_mp}{total\_gr\_3\_stu} \right)
\]

#### Final Points (0 or 5 points)
- **5 pts if:**  
  - **≤12% MP** OR  
  - **Maintains/decreases MP from FY 2024 to FY 2025.**

### Chronic Absenteeism Reduction Component

#### Intent & Details
- Aims to **reduce** students absent >10% of the school year.
- **Arizona Online Instruction (AOI) Adjustments:**  
  - Uses **attendance minutes** instead of days.  
  - Chronic absenteeism if:  
    \[
    \frac{\text{Attendance Minutes}}{\text{Required Minutes}} < 90\%
    \]  
  - Attendance minutes calculated based on [A.R.S. § 15-808](https://www.azleg.gov/ars/15/00808.htm).


Inclusion Criteria:
- Grades 1-8 in fiscal year 2025.
- Grades 1-8 in fiscal year 2024 establish the baseline comparison.
- Includes both FAY and non-FAY students.
- Excludes students flagged as chronically ill in AzEDS.
- Includes all absences reported, whether excused or unexcused.
- AOI students must be Full-Time Equivalent (FTE 1.0).
- Minimum N-Size of 10 students is required.

Formula:
\[
pct\_chronic\_absent = 100 \left( \frac{n\_chronic\_absent}{total\_students} \right)
\]

Final Points for Chronic Absenteeism Reduction (0 or 2 points):
- Schools earn 2 points if:
  - Chronic Absenteeism is ≤ 4% in fiscal year 2025.
  - Chronic Absenteeism percentage in fiscal year 2025 is the same or lower than in fiscal year 2024.

K-8 Subgroup Improvement Component:

Component Intent:
- Measures annual improvement in proficiency points for subgroups on AASA/MSAA-ELA and math.

Eligibility:
- Each subgroup must have at least 10 FAY students in both fiscal years 2025 and 2024.
- Maximum points capped at 6.

Formula for Subgroup Proficiency Improvement:
\[
sg\_test\_change = 100 \left( \frac{[0.6 \times n\_fay\_PP\_cy + 1.0 \times n\_fay\_P\_cy + 1.3 \times n\_fay\_HP\_cy]}{n\_fay\_tested\_cy} - \frac{[0.6 \times n\_fay\_PP\_py + 1.0 \times n\_fay\_P\_py + 1.3 \times n\_fay\_HP\_py]}{n\_fay\_tested\_py} \right)
\]

Final Points for Subgroup Improvement (0, 2, 4, or 6 points):
- Schools earn 2 points if the change in average proficiency points earned for the test is greater than 0.

Special Education Inclusion Component:

Component Intent:
- Rewards schools with higher than state average special education students in general education classrooms (80% of the day or more).

Inclusion Criteria:
- K-8 students receiving special education services on October 1, 2024.
- Must meet minimum n-size of 10 FAY students.

Formula for Special Education Inclusion:
\[
\text{sch\_sped\_inclusion\_pct} = 100 \left( \frac{\text{oct\_1\_sped\_included}}{\text{n\_fay\_students}} \right)
\]

Final Points for Special Education Inclusion (0 or 2 points):
- Schools earn 2 points if their percentage of K-8 students enrolled in special education services and participating in the general education classroom 80% or more of the day is higher than the state average.
