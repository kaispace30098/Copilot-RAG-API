     - If **No**, proceed to the next step.
     - If **Yes**, follow the path to the next question.

2. **Subsequent Question**:
   - **Did the student graduate from your school in the 2023 fiscal year prior to Jan. 31, 2023?**
     - If **No**, the student should not be included in the school's 2022 On-Track Graduation data submission.
     - If **Yes**, the student should be included in the school's data submission.

### Decision Outcomes:
