## Calculating LEA Letter Grades

For school year 2024-2025 LEAs will also receive a letter grade. LEAs with only one school will receive the grade of that school.

## Calculation

The figure presents a mathematical formula for calculating the `lea_gpa`. The formula is expressed as:

$$
lea\_gpa = \left( \frac{(n\_A\_schools \times 4) + (n\_B\_schools \times 3) + (n\_C\_schools \times 2) + (n\_D\_schools \times 1)}{n\_schools} \right)
$$

- **Variables**:
  - `n_A_schools`: Number of schools with an A grade.
  - `n_B_schools`: Number of schools with a B grade.
  - `n_C_schools`: Number of schools with a C grade.
  - `n_D_schools`: Number of schools with a D grade.
  - `n_schools`: Total number of schools.

- **Operation**:
  - Each category of schools (A, B, C, D) is multiplied by a weight (4, 3, 2, 1 respectively).
  - The sum of these products is divided by the total number of schools (`n_schools`) to calculate the `lea_gpa`.

## Instructions

Round the lea_gpa to the nearest whole number, and convert to a letter grade using the scale below:

- 4 = A
- 3 = B
- 2 = C
- 1 = D
- 0 = F

## Variables

- **lea_gpa**: the average points earned for school letter grades
- **n_A_schools**: the number of A schools in the LEA
- **n_B_schools**: the number of B schools in the LEA
- **n_C_schools**: the number of C schools in the LEA
- **n_D_schools**: the number of D schools in the LEA
- **n_schools**: the number of schools in the LEA
