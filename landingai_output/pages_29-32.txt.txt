### Indicator Intent

Awards schools points for student progress on state assessments. It fairly compares students entering at different levels and reflects academic growth even if standards aren’t met.

### Indicator Details

- **Measures:** Typically based on Student Growth Percentile (SGP) and Student Growth Target (SGT). For 2024-2025, SGT is excluded.
- **Prospective SGTs:** ADE will produce these for grades 3–9 for the 2025–2026 school year to guide instruction.
- **SGP Definition:** Reflects a student’s growth relative to peers with similar prior scores (range 1–99; e.g., an SGP of 40 means growth above 40% of peers).
- **Separate SGPs:** Calculated for ELA and Math.
- **Weighting:** Final scores are weighted based on prior-year achievement and growth.
- **Data Source:** Only state assessment results are used (no demographic comparisons).

### SGP Categorization

- FAY students’ SGPs are categorized into:
  - 1 = Low (SGP 1–33)
  - 2 = Average (SGP 34–66)
  - 3 = High (SGP 67–99)
- For FY 2025, growth is calculated from 2023–2025 scores (grades 4–8 use AASA; cohort 2024 uses ACT Aspire).
- For Traditional 9–12, Growth replaces the Subgroup Improvement Indicator (using Cohort 2023 ACT Aspire to current ACT).

### Calculation: SGP

**Inclusion Criteria:**
- Students with a '1' in the StateGrowth column.
- FAY students in grades 4–8 (cohort 2024) with matching enrolled and assessment grades.
- Valid AASA or ACT scores (ACT ELA is the average of English, Reading, and Writing).
- Must have valid test records for 2024–2025 and corresponding records from 2023 (or 2024 for cohort 2024).
- Minimum of 10 FAY students with current and prior records.
- **Excludes:** MSAA scores due to insufficient statewide data.

- Points are awarded based on previous year scores and growth.
