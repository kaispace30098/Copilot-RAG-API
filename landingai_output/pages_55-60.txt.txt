### Updates for Fiscal Year 2025

- No updates to the Growth to Graduation Indicator for FY 2025.

--------------------------------------------------

## Academic Persistence Component

**Intent:**  
Reward Alternative 9-12 schools whose grade 9–12 students (from the 2022–2023 school year with an applicable Year-End Status Code) re-enrolled at any Arizona public school by October 1, 2024.

**Details:**  
- Data is validated using the “Persistence Rate Report” in ADEConnect.  
- Includes DRP Enrolled Students with an applicable prior withdrawal code.

**Calculation (0–10 points):**

Inclusion: Grade 9–12 students from 2022–2023 meeting the criteria.

**Equation:**

$$
persistence\_pts = 10 \left( \frac{n\_reenrolled\_oct1}{n\_eligible\_students} \right)
$$

**Variables:**  
- **persistence_pts:** Points awarded (max 10).  
- **n_eligible_students:** Number of eligible grade 9–12 students from 2022–2023.  
- **n_reenrolled_oct1:** Number of eligible students who re-enrolled by October 1.

--------------------------------------------------

## Credits Earned Component

**Intent:**  
Reward schools for helping students earn the required credits toward graduation.

**Details:**  
- Schools report the percentage of students (meeting inclusion criteria) who earned ≥4.5 credits or the remaining credits needed by June 30, 2025.  
- Data must be submitted via the ADEConnect Excel template (only LEA, school info, and SSIDs are included).  
- If fewer than 10 eligible students, schools submit “N/A” to remove the component from the final grade.

**Calculation (0–10 points):**

**Equation:**

$$
\text{creds\_earned\_pts} = 10 \left( \frac{\text{n\_stu\_completing\_req\_creds}}{\text{n\_enrolled\_80\_days}} \right)
$$

**Variables:**  
- **creds_earned_pts:** Points awarded for credits earned.  
- **n_stu_completing_req_creds:** Number of students meeting the credit requirement.  
- **n_enrolled_80_days:** Total number of students meeting the enrollment criteria.

--------------------------------------------------
#Growth to Graduation Calculation
## On-Track to Graduate Component

**Intent:**  
Award points for students reported as on-track to graduate.

**Details:**  
- Alternative 9–12 schools submit data twice (Initial: March 15, 2025; Final: July 31, 2025) via ADEConnect.  
- Submission must include only LEA info and SSIDs.  
- If <10 eligible students, schools submit “N/A” to exclude the component.

**Inclusion Criteria:**  
Students are included if they satisfy **either**:  
- **Condition 1:** Enrolled on January 31, 2025, need ≤3 credits to meet graduation requirements and ≤1 remaining math credit; or  
- **Condition 2:** Graduated during 2024–2025 before January 31, 2025.  
- DRP students meeting criteria are also included.

**Calculation (0–10 points):**

**Equation:**

$$
\text{otg\_pts} = 10 \left( \frac{n\_graduated}{n\_on\_track\_to\_graduation} \right)
$$

**Variables:**  
- **otg_pts:** Points awarded for On-Track to Graduate.  
- **n_graduated:** Number of students who graduated (from the on-track list).  
- **n_on_track_to_graduation:** Number of students initially reported as on-track.
