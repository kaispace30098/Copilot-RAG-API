### Updates for Fiscal Year 2025

- No updates to CCRI for school year 2024-2025.

### Indicator Intent

- Award points to schools that encourage graduates to engage in activities preparing them for post-secondary success.

### Indicator Details

- CCRI scores are self-reported via ADEConnect by **July 31, 2025**.
- Schools ineligible for CCRI points must submit a Self-Report indicating ineligibility (to remove the Indicator from the final grade, not to receive 0 points).
- Students concurrently enrolled at multiple schools are reported for their diploma-issuing school.
- Documentation must be available if monitored.
- Schools may download a student-level spreadsheet from ADEConnect for calculations.
