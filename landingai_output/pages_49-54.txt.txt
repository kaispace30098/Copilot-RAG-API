### Updates for Fiscal Year 2025

- Traditional 9-12 schools not earning at least 10 points in the 4/5/6/7-year graduation rate component will have points prorated.
- Clarified intent for students with disabilities needing >4 years of services.

### Description

- **Symbol:** A circular arrow inside a circle indicates rotation/recycling.
- **Graduation Image:** The word "GRADUATION" in bold, uppercase letters on a red background.

### Component Intent

- **Traditional Schools:** Hold schools accountable across multiple cohorts without penalizing for appropriate IEPs; contact ADE if data issues arise.
- **Alternative Schools:** Focus on student progression across cohorts.

### Component Details

- Minimum of 10 students per 4-year cohort is required.
- Graduation rate data is finalized with a one-year lag.
- **Traditional 9-12:** Cohorts are weighted with highest emphasis on the 4-year rate (capped at 10 points). Points for graduation rate and improvement are considered separately.
- **Alternative 9-12:** Schools earn points for the best graduation rate among 4-, 5-, 6-, or 7-year rates.

**Table Representation (Example):**

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Graduation Rate Type</th>
    <th>Cohort</th>
    <th>Weight</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>4-year</td>
    <td>2024</td>
    <td>5.0%</td>
  </tr>

### Graduation Rate Calculation

**Inclusion Criteria:** Students in the given cohort.

**Variables:**
- **grad_rt:** Graduation rate for a cohort.
- **grads:** Number of graduates (year-end codes: G, W7, S7).
- **non_grads:** All others (excluding specific exit codes).

**Graduation Rate Formula:**

$$
grad\_rt = 100 \left( \frac{grads}{grads + non\_grads} \right)
$$

### Graduation Rate Component

**Traditional 9-12 (0-10 points):**
- Includes cohorts 2021–2024 (both FAY and non-FAY; minimum n-count of 10).
- **Key-Value Formula:**

$$
grad\_rt\_pts\_{trad} = 0.05 \times (cohort\_2024\_grad\_rt4) + 0.04 \times (cohort\_2023\_grad\_rt5) + 0.025 \times (cohort\_2022\_grad\_rt6) + 0.005 \times (cohort\_2021\_grad\_rt7)
$$

**Alternative 9-12 (0-10 points):**
- Uses the best graduation rate among the types.
- **Formula:**

$$
grad\_rt\_pts\_{alt} = 0.1 \times (max\_grad\_rt\_type)
$$

### Graduation Improvement Component (Traditional 9-12 only)

**Intent:**  
Encourage increases in the 4-year graduation rate for cohort 2024 compared to 2023 or maintain ≥90%.

**Points Table:**

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>The cohort 2024 4-year graduation rate is…</th>
    <th>Points</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>90% or higher</td>
    <td>10</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Greater than cohort 2023 rate + 2</td>
    <td>10</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Equal to cohort 2023 rate ± 2</td>
    <td>5</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Less than cohort 2023 rate - 2</td>
    <td>0</td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Final Graduation Indicator Points

**Traditional 9-12 (0-20 points):**

$$
grad\_indicator\_pts = grad\_rt\_pts\_{trad} + grad\_rt\_imp\_pts
$$

**Alternative 9-12 (0-10 points):**

$$
grad\_indicator\_pts = \frac{grad\_rt\_pts}{all}
$$

**Variables:**
- **grad_indicator_pts:** Final graduation indicator points.
- **grad_rt_pts_trad:** Points from graduation rate (Traditional 9-12).
- **grad_rt_pts_alt:** Points from graduation rate (Alternative 9-12).
- **grad_rt_imp_pts:** Points from graduation improvement (Traditional 9-12 only).
