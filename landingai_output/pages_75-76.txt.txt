**Details**

- Bonus points are added after the percentage of points earned in all other indicators is calculated to a 100-point scale. This approach makes the value of bonus points equivalent across all schools on a given A-F model.

## Eligibility Criteria

- Small schools with fewer than 10 FAY students will receive a designation of Not Rated.
- A school with a new entity ID whose first year in operation is the 2024-2025 school year will not receive an A-F letter grade score.
- In order to receive an A-F letter grade score, schools must be eligible for the minimum point threshold corresponding to their A-F model in the table below. Schools that do not meet the eligibility threshold will receive a designation of Not Rated (NR).

### Table Representation

The table below outlines the minimum eligible points required for different educational models:

<table>

## Calculations

### K-8 Schools

- $k8\_score = 100 \left( \frac{proficiency + growth + el + accel\_ready}{sum\_eligible\_points} \right) + bonus\_points$

### 9-12 Schools

- $9\_12\_score = 100 \left( \frac{proficiency + growth  + el + grad + ccri}{sum\_eligible\_points} \right) + bonus\_points$

### Alternative 9-12 Schools

- $alt\_score = 100 \left( \frac{proficiency + gtg + el + grad + ccri}{sum\_eligible\_points} \right) + bonus\_points$

## Calculating Final A-F Letter Grade Score
### Non-Typical Schools

The formula for calculating the non-typical score is given by:

$$
non\_typical\_score = 100 \left[ \left( \frac{k8\_pct \times k8\_pts+}{912\_pct \times 912\_pts+} \right) \left( \frac{k8\_pct \times k8\_pts\_eligible+}{912\_pct \times 912\_pts\_eligible} \right) \right] + \left( \frac{k8\_pct \times k8\_bonus+}{912\_pct \times 912\_bonus} \right)
$$
