## Cut Scores

- To place all schools on an equivalent scale, cut scores are established on a 100-point scale, based on the percentage of eligible points each school earns.
- Pursuant to A.R.S. § 15-241.02(D), schools that receive three consecutive D's "shall be assigned a letter grade of F unless an alternate letter grade is assigned after an appeal...". Schools receiving a third "D" letter grade are assigned a "D" in the initial release of A-F Letter Grades. If the school does not file an appeal of their grade, it is changed to an F following the close of the A-F Letter Grade Appeal window.
- The table below shows cut scores approved by the State Board of Education for school years 2023-2024 and 2022-2023.
