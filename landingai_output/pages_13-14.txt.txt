## Statutory Provisions (LAW)

As outlined by A.R.S. §15-241, the State Board of Education (SBE) determined the criteria for each school classification. Details regarding A-F and the process can be found at [https://azsbe.az.gov/f-school-letter-grades](https://azsbe.az.gov/f-school-letter-grades). The 2024 A-F models were approved on pending.

Per A.R.S. §15-241 (b), "Each school, charter holder and school district shall submit to the department any data that is required and requested and that is necessary to compile the achievement profile. A school or local education agency that fails to submit the information that is necessary is not eligible to receive monies from the classroom site improvement fund established by section 15-977".
